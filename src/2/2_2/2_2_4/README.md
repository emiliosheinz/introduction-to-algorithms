How can you modify any sorting algorithm to have a good best-case running time?

## Solution

By incorporating techniques such as early exit conditions, efficient data structures, preprocessing, heuristics, and algorithmic paradigm shifts, we can significantly improve the performance of our algorithms under favorable conditions. For example, for the Selection Sort algorithm we could instead check if the array is already ordered (Θ(n)) and then return it without making any modifications, that would change the best-case execution time from Θ(n^2) to Θ(n).
