How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

## Solution

The shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems are similar in that they both involve finding the shortest path between two points. However, the shortest-path problem involves finding the shortest path between two points, while the traveling-salesman problem involves finding the shortest path between multiple points that returns to the first point.
