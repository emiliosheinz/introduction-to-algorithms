# 1.1-6
Describe a real-world algorithm in which sometimes the entire input is available before you need to solve the problem, but other times the input is not entirely available in advance and arrives over time.

## Solution

As an example, we can consider the sorting algorithms **selection sort** and **insertion sort**. Selection sort repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted remainder and places it at the front, which requires access to the entire input. On the other hand, insertion sort considers one input element per iteration and produces a partial solution without considering future elements.
