Select a data structure that you have seen, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

## Solution

The chosen data structure is a **Stack**, which is a data structure that follows the **LIFO** (Last In First Out) principle. The main operations of a stack are **push** and **pop**. 

**Strengths:**
- It's very easy to implement
- Operations all have a time complexity of O(1) (constant)
- Can be used to perform powerful operations

**Limitations:**
- It's not very flexible, it's not possible to access elements in the middle of the stack
- It's not possible to search it quickly (O(n) time complexity)
- Deleting a particular item from the stack is also not quick (O(n) time complexity)
