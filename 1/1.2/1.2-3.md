**What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is 100n^2 runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is 2^n on the same machine?**

The smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is 100n^2 runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is 2^n on the same machine is 15.

```python
n = 1
while 100 * n * n > 2 ** n:
    n += 1
    
print("Minimum value of n for which A runs faster than B is", n)
```
