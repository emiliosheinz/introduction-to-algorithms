**Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.**

E-commerce's product lists can be sorted by price, popularity, etc. These are all algorithms that need to be implemented at the application level. For sorting a product list by price we could use a algorithm such as Mergesort which guarantees that the worst case running time is O(nlogn).
