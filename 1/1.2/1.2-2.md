# 1.2-2
**Suppose that for inputs of size n on a particular computer, insertion sort runs in 8n^2 steps and merge sort runs in 64nlgn steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort**

The values of n for which insertion beats merge sort is 2 <= n <= 43.

while n > 2 ** (n / 8.0):
    n += 1
