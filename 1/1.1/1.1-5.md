# 1.1-5
**Suggest a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then suggest one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough.**

Using the example given in the 1.1-4 question, we can say that a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do is finding the shortest path between two points (shortest-path). A real-world problem in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough is finding the shortest path between multiple points that returns to the first point (traveling-salesman).
