**Describe a real-world algorithm in which sometimes the entire input is available before you need to solve the problem, but other times the input is not entirely available in advance and arrives over time.**

Hospital Emergency are a good example of this. For example, they make triage decisions without knowing when other patients will arrive. They have to make decisions based on the information they have at the time, and then update their decisions as new information arrives.
